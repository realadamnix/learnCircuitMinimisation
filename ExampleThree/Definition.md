# What is Kmaping in kavanagh  Map?

## Definition

K-mapping is a technique used to simplify boolean expressions. It is also known as Kavanagh Map. It is a graphical representation of a truth table. It is used to simplify boolean expressions by grouping the minterms or maxterms that have the same output value. 

The K-Map is a two-dimensional grid with rows and columns representing the input variables. The cells in the grid represent the output of the boolean expression for each combination of input variables. The K-Map is used to identify patterns in the output values and simplify the boolean expression. The Kmap is a useful tool for simplifying complex boolean expressions and reducing the number of gates in a circuit.

## Example

For example, consider the boolean expression $\bar{A}B + A\bar{B} + AB$. The K-Map for this expression is as follows:

| A | B | Q | name |
|---|---|---|------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | m0   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | m1   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | m2   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | m3   |

|           | $\bar{B}$ | $B$ |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| $\bar{A}$ | m0        | m1  |
| $A$       | m2        | m3  |

|           | $\bar{B}$ | $B$ |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| $\bar{A}$ |           | 1   |
| $A$       | 1         | 1   |

$A + B$

$\overline{\bar{A} \cdot \bar{B}}  = \bar{\bar{A}} + \bar{\bar{B}} = A + B$

The simplified expression is A XOR B.
