# Question 1: Determine the expression for the following kmaps

## a

|     | C'| C |
|-----|---|---|
| A'B'| 0 | 1 |
| A'B | 0 | 1 |
| A B | 0 | 1 |
| A B'| 0 | 1 |

C doesn't change, so it is 1. A and B are the same, so it is 0. The expression is C.

This is because the output is 1 when C is 1, regardless of the value of A and B.

Answer = C
